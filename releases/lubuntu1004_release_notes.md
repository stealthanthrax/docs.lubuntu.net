# lubuntu 10.04 Release Notes


### What is Lubuntu
Lubuntu is a Ubuntu variant using the LXDE desktop. It’s designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use desktop environment. Lubuntu is currently not part of the Ubuntu family, and not build with the current Ubuntu infrastructure. This release is considered as a « stable beta », a result that could be a final and stable release if it was included in the Ubuntu family. Please note also that Lubuntu 10.04 is not a LTS version. For the future we aim to include all packages of lubuntu in the Ubuntu repository.
