# lubuntu 11.04 Release Notes


Lubuntu 11.04 is, of course, based on the lightweight LXDE desktop environment and Ubuntu 11.04, with the PCManFM 0.9.8 as the default file manager, LXDM as the default display manager, and Chromium as the default web browser.

Improvements in Lubuntu 11.04 included replacing Aqualung with Audacious as the default music player, elimination of the hardware abstraction layer, introducing movable desktop icons, the Ubuntu font being used by default, improved menu translations and reorganized menus. 

Lubuntu 11.04 can be run with as little as 128 MB of RAM, but requires 256 MB of RAM to install using the graphical installer.
