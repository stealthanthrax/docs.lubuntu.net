## System Requirements
Lubuntu is a good operating system for many old computers, but not for all of them. Some computers have too little horsepower or memory. A rule of thumb is that the computer should not be more than 10 years old.

__Memory (RAM)__
<br>
For advanced internet services like Google+, YouTube, Google Drive, and Facebook, your computer needs at least 1 GB of RAM.

For local programs like LibreOffice and simple browsing habits, your computer needs at least 512 MB of RAM.

__Processor (CPU)__
<br>
The minimum specification for CPU is Pentium 4 or Pentium M or AMD K8. Older processors are too slow and the AMD K7 has problems with Flash video.

## Lubuntu-specific Bugs
These are maintained by the Lubuntu team.

__### LXDE__
* run dialog called from one desktop opens on the desktop with preferences dialog, regardless of which desktop is current ([1445818](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxpanel/+bug/1445818)).

* changing multiple desktop names only results in the first being changed. ([1522625](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/obconf/+bug/1522625)).

__### Lubuntu Installer__
* All images require a DVD or USB. As a workaround, use the [server or netboot](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Alternate_ISO#CD_image) images.

* GTK warning about "The :insensitive pseudo-class is deprecated. Use :disabled instead." in Lubuntu 16.10 installer output ([1633135](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1633135)).
